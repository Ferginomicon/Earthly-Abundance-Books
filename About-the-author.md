**HippieJesus** is the spiritual resurrection of the man once known as Jesus. 
As the living embodiment of faith, this truthsayer has returned to the physical realm once again,
 this time to stop the destruction of our planet and all forms of life on it by the forces of evil. 
To achieve this incredible goal, he established a philosophical and lifestyle path he 
calls [Earthly Abundance](https://www.earthlyabundance.org), which allows people to create a way forward 
to a future where deceivers are recognized and understood as the bad examples for the rest of humanity that
they truly are. These ideas of championing honesty and accountability help form the underlying basis of [Earthly Abundance](https://www.earthlyabundance.org).
